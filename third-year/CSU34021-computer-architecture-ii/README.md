## Module Learning Outcomes

1. Write simple IA32 and x64 assembly language functions;
2. Explain the IA32 and x64 procedure calling conventions;
3. Describe the RISC design philosophy and translate simple high level language programs into RISC-I assembly language;
4. Explain the key concepts behind instruction level pipelining and know how to apply a number of techniques to overcome data, load and control hazards;
5. Explain the advantages of using virtual memory, show how virtual addresses are mapped to physical addresses and demonstrate how the functionality of a MMU is integrated into an operating system;
6. Explain the use of a memory hierarchy to reduce effective memory access times, describe the organisation and operation of a cache;
7. Discuss the problems of using caches in a multiprocessor, analyse the operation of several cache coherency protocols.

## Module Content

Topics covered in this module are:

- Basic IA32 and x64 assembly language;
- Procedure calling conventions (IA32 and x64);
- RISC vs CISC, RISC-1 design criteria and architecture, register windows and delayed jumps;
- Instruction level pipelining, DLX/MIPS pipeline, resolving data, load and control hazards;
- Virtual Memory, memory management units (MMUs), multi-level page tables, TLBs, integration of a MMU into an operating system;
- Cache organization (L, K and N), operation, performance, cache coherency;
- Multiprocessor architectures, cache coherency protocols (write-through, write-once, Firefly and MESI).
