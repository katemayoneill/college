Percentage to Grade Converter Assignment

Using a switch statement and a do-while loop write a program/class (called PercentageToGradeConverter) to repeatedly accept a percentage from the user and output the corresponding College grade.  The program should terminate once quit is entered.  Invalid input and numbers should be handled appropriately. Grades are based on rounded percentages as follows:  I (70+), II.1 (60-69), II.2 (50-59), III (40-49), F1 (35-39), F2 (0-34).  Note that you must use the input & output text as shown in the sample expected input/output (for automatic testing purposes).
Sample expected input/output (user input in green):
Enter a percentage (or 'quit' to finish)> 65.0
The grade for 65.0% is a II.1
Enter a percentage (or 'quit' to finish)> 69.5
The grade for 69.5% is a I
Enter a percentage (or 'quit' to finish)> 39.4
The grade for 39.4% is an F1
Enter a percentage (or 'quit' to finish)> 31
The grade for 31.0% is an F2
Enter a percentage (or 'quit' to finish)> 43
The grade for 43.0% is a III
Enter a percentage (or 'quit' to finish)> 50.3
The grade for 50.3% is a II.2
Enter a percentage (or 'quit' to finish)> rubbish
Error: Enter a number between 0.0 and 100.0, or the word quit to exit the program.
Enter a percentage (or 'quit' to finish)>  105
Error: Percentages must be between 0.0% and 100.0%
Enter a percentage (or 'quit' to finish)> quit

Submission

This assignment (your PercentageToGradeConverter.java file) must be submitted via Web-CAT (at https://webcat.scss.tcd.ie/cs2012/) by Sunday November 14th at 23:55.  The Web-CAT system will automatically evaluate whether you solved the problem correctly using a number of test cases and will also evaluate whether you used the correct prompts and correct output format.  75% of the marks for this assignment will be awarded automatically based on this Web-CAT evaluation.  You may submit to (and have your code evaluated by) the Web-CAT system as often as you like before the deadline.
Before you submit though you need to self-assess whether you addressed the requirements to make your code easy to understand.  Copy the multi line comment below and put it at the top of your program.  Put in a mark and a comment for each criterion (even if you have given yourself full marks, otherwise marks will be deducted per criterion that is missing this information).  This self-assessment will be used when the demonstrator marks the understandability of your code (counting in this case for 25% of the marks).
