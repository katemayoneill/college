BMI tutorial/lab problem

Write a program/class (which you must call BMI) which computes the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person.  The BMI is computed by dividing the weight of a person (in kgs) by the square of the height of the person in meters.
Notes:
Your program will have input, computation and output.
You should use the command line for input and output.
The format and output of your input and output MUST be the same as shown in the Sample Input/Output.  This is important as it will affect the automatic part of the grading of your work.
Sample expected input/output
What is your weight in kg? 80
What is your height in metres? 1.8
Your BMI is 24.691358024691358

TASKS FOR THE LAB and the rest of the week.

You should already have Eclipse installed and have created a Java Project and run a program.  (Two pre-recorded 5 minute guides were provided to help you in Week 1).  If you have had problems talk to someone in the Face-to-Face or Tutorial or Lab session.
Try to get your BMI program running.  Use the demonstrators.  Ask them questions if you are stuck.
If everything is working correctly then try to make your programs fail.  Look closely at what happens.  Learn how to debug programs.  (There is a prerecorded 5 minute session to show you how to do this).
Log in to Web-CAT (at https://webcat.scss.tcd.ie/cs2012/) and practice submitting programs.  Details below.   Your username and password are both set to your ID number.  You should change your password immediately.  This assignment does not count towards your grade at the end of the year, but they will from next week - so this is your opportunity to get any problems sorted out.  If you don't do this and have problems submitting next week, you may end up getting 0 for next week's assignment!  (Again there is a prerecorded session to show you how to do all this).

Submission

This assignment does not count towards your grade at the end of the year.  However to get some experience of using the automatic grading system you should submit the BMI program via Web-CAT (at https://webcat.scss.tcd.ie/cs2012/) by Sunday October 10th at 23:55.  The Web-CAT system will automatically evaluate whether you solved the problem correctly using a number of test cases and will also evaluate whether you used the correct prompts and correct output format.  100% of the marks for this assignment will be awarded automatically based on this Web-CAT evaluation.  You may submit to (and have your code evaluated by) the Web-CAT system as often as you like before the deadline.
Normally, before you submit though you need to self-assess whether you addressed the requirements to make your code easy to understand.  You will be asked to copy the multi line comment below and put it at the top of your program.  Put in a mark and a comment for each criterion (even if you have given yourself full marks, otherwise marks will be deducted per criterion that is missing this information).  This self-assessment would normally be used by the demonstrator when he/she marks the understandability of your code.
/*  SELF ASSESSMENT of whether my code is easy to understand.

   1. Did I use easy-to-understand meaningful variable names?
       Mark out of 10:   
       Comment: 
   3. Did I format the variable names properly (in lowerCamelCase)?
       Mark out of 10:   
       Comment: 
   5. Did I indent the code appropriately?
       Mark out of 10:   
       Comment: 
     Total Mark out of  30 (Add all the previous marks):
