Stopping Distance AssignmentStopping Distance Assignment

Write a program/class in Java (which you must call StoppingDistance1) to compute how long it would take in metres to stop a vehicle based on the speed that it is travelling at (in kilometres per hour) and the reaction time of the driver (in seconds).  The stopping distance is to be computed as the sum of the reaction distance (which is the speed in metres per second times the reaction time in seconds) and the braking distance (which is the square of the speed in metres per second divided by 20).  You must use exactly the same formatting (language, spacing, etc.) as shown in the expected input/output is shown below.

Sample expected input/output (user input in green):
Enter vehicle speed in km/hr> 55.52
Enter reaction time in seconds> 3.21
At a speed of 55.5km/hr and with a reaction time of 3.2s, the stopping distance would be 61.4m

Submission

This assignment must be submitted via Web-CAT (at https://webcat.scss.tcd.ie/cs2012/) by Sunday October 17th at 23:55.  The Web-CAT system will automatically evaluate whether you solved the problem correctly using a number of test cases and will also evaluate whether you used the correct prompts and correct output format.  60% of the marks for this assignment will be awarded automatically based on this Web-CAT evaluation.  You may submit to (and have your code evaluated by) the Web-CAT system as often as you like before the deadline.
Before you submit though you need to self-assess whether you addressed the requirements to make your code easy to understand.  Copy the multi line comment below and put it at the top of your program.  Put in a mark and a comment for each criterion (even if you have given yourself full marks, otherwise marks will be deducted per criterion that is missing this information).  This self-assessment will be used when the demonstrator marks the understandability of your code (counting in this case for 40% of the marks).
/*  SELF ASSESSMENT of whether my code is easy to understand.
   1. Did I use appropriate CONSTANTS instead of numbers within the code?
       Mark out of 5:    
       Comment:
   2. Did I use easy-to-understand, meaningful CONSTANT names?
       Mark out of 5:   
       Comment: 
   3. Did I format the CONSTANT names properly (in UPPERCASE)?
       Mark out of 5:

   4. Did I use easy-to-understand meaningful variable names?
       Mark out of 10:
