Part 1:
Update the Bank program to create two methods, one overriding the other, named findCustomer() which returns the name of the customer from the array passed to the method.
The first method uses the parameters account number and the array BankCustomer[]. The second method uses the parameters date of birth, address and the array BankCustomer[].
Part 2:
Update the bank program to use an ArrayList instead of an Array. Write a method findCustomer(ArrayList<BankCustomer> array, int accNumber) to find a customer of the bank.
