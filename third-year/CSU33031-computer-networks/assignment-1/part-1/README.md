An indicative marking scheme for the submissions for part 1 of the assignment is as follow:  

- 1 point - for providing a video
- 2 points - the before + and demonstrating a traffic capture
- 3 points - the before + an explanation of network traffic
- 4 points - the before + demonstrating that they have started on their own protocol
- 5 points - the before + demonstrating their own protocol on virtual infrastructure

The video should describe your progress in the first couple of weeks. I think of these videos as a replacement of an update in a standup meeting where you have been given the task to implement this protocol and during a regular meeting you need update your team on your progress i.e. what you have done, what your thoughts are behind your decisions and then what you plan is going forward.
