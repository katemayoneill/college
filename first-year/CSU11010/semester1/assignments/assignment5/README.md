Range of Heights Assignment
Using a while loop write a program/class (which you must call RangeOfHeights) to repeatedly get heights from the user, outputting the maximum and minimum heights entered so far after each height has been entered.  If a negative height is entered the user should be told that it is invalid and asked to try again.  The program must terminate when zero is entered.  Note that you must use the input & output text as shown in the sample expected input/output (for automatic testing purposes).

Sample expected input/output (user input in green):
Enter a height in metres (0.0 to finish)> 1.85
Heights entered so far are in the range 1.85 to 1.85
Enter a height in metres (0.0 to finish)> 2.00
Heights entered so far are in the range 1.85 to 2.0
Enter a height in metres (0.0 to finish)> 2.3
Heights entered so far are in the range 1.85 to 2.3
Enter a height in metres (0.0 to finish)> -1.23
Negative heights are invalid.
Enter a height in metres (0.0 to finish)> 1.9
Heights entered so far are in the range 1.85 to 2.3
Enter a height in metres (0.0 to finish)> 1.2
Heights entered so far are in the range 1.2 to 2.3
Enter a height in metres (0.0 to finish)> 0.0
 
Submission
This assignment must be submitted via Web-CAT (at https://webcat.scss.tcd.ie/cs2012/) by Sunday November 7th at 23:55.  The Web-CAT system will automatically evaluate whether you solved the problem correctly using a number of test cases and will also evaluate whether you used the correct prompts and correct output format.  75% of the marks for this assignment will be awarded automatically based on this Web-CAT evaluation.  You may submit to (and have your code evaluated by) the Web-CAT system as often as you like before the deadline.
Before you submit though you need to self-assess whether you addressed the requirements to make your code easy to understand.  Copy the multi line comment below and put it at the top of your program.  Put in a mark and a comment for each criterion (even if you have given yourself full marks, otherwise marks will be deducted per criterion that is missing this information).  This self-assessment will be used when the demonstrator marks the understandability of your code (counting in this case for 25% of the marks).
