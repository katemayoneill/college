Part1:
Update the BankCustomer class creating an array storing data of type bankCustomerArray and add your BankCustomer to this array.
Part2:
The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:
1.Only one disk can be moved at a time
2.Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack
3.No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk
Write a Java program that asks the user to input the number of disks and implements a recursive function to implement your solution.
